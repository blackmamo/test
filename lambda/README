This directory is for all of the backend modules we will have.

The intention of splitting up packages here is that we can subdivide the app into multiple apis e.g.
an interview scheduling api, candidate api, job api. Each can be managed and built separately. Also
when layers are supported by terraform.

If things grow and the build slows down too much, we may want to investigate ways to only build and
test (and deploy) things that actually changed
